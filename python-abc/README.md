This directory containswork with abstract classes and duck typing.
Abstract classes are a special kind of base class. This type of class requires a minimum of 1 @abstractmethod to be defined.
Duck typing is a feature in python. During run time python checks for attributes to classify objects before checking theyre actual class, this means that if two classes share the same attribute during run time they are considered equal.
